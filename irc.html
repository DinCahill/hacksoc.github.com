<p>IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is a protocol with a long and glorious
history stretching back into the mists of time. It's a pretty simple
system for online chatrooms, and you don't even need a special program
to connect to it, although they do exist.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You don't need a special program: see the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=cs-york">web chat</a></li>

  <li>You don't talk to individuals on a contact list, you join channels: a group of people talking about the same topic.</li>

  <li>When you start up a client you'll have to connect to a server and channel. We use <strong>#cs-york</strong> on <strong>irc.freenode.net</strong></li>

  <li>You can change your name with <code>/nick new_name</code>, and join a new channel with <code>/join #channel_name</code></li>
</ol>
